**Basel-I (1998)**
   - Published a set of minimum capital requirements for banks
   - It focused almost entirely on credit risk (default risk) - the risk of counter party failure.
   - It defined  capital requirement and structure of risk weights for banks
   - risk weights of 0%(Cash, Bullion, Home Country Debt Like Treasuries), 10, 20, 50 and100% and no rating. 
   - The weight of zero was assigned to assets such as loans lent to OECD states or similar.
   - Loans or investment with domestic public sector enterprises were given risk weights ranging from 0% to 50% at the discretion of nation’s regulator , 
     which could be 0%, 10%, 20% and 50%.
   - Loans or investment with institutions such as Multilateral development banks, were assigned a weight of 20%.
   - Loans to non-OECD banks given on a tenor of more than 1 year are assigned a weight of 50%.
   - Loans or investment with private sector enterprises, were assigned a weight of 100%.
   - Banks with an international presence are required to hold capital equal to 8% of their RWA - At least, 4% in Tier I Capital (Equity Capital + retained earnings) 
     and more than 8% in Tier I and Tier II Capital
   - Major problems with definition of Capital and Differential RWA across countries, like Basel  standards are computed on the  basis  of book-value accounting 
     measures of capital, not market values. 
     
**Basel-II (2004)**
   - Basel II is a second international banking regulatory accord that is based on three main pillars: minimal capital requirements, regulatory supervision and market discipline. 
   - laid down guidelines for capital adequacy (with more refined definitions), risk management (Market Risk and Operational Risk) and disclosure requirements.
   - use of external ratings  agencies to set the risk weights for corporate, bank and sovereign claims 
   - Under the new approach risk weights may range from 0% to 150%.

**Basel-III (2004)**
 - Basel II did not have any explicit  regulation on the debt that banks could take on their books, and focused  more on individual financial institutions, 
   while ignoring systemic  risk.
 - To ensure that banks don’t take on excessive debt, and that they  don’t rely too much on short term funds.
 - The guidelines aim to promote a more resilient banking system by  focusing on four vital banking parameters viz. capital, leverage,  funding and liquidity
 - Requirements for common equity and Tier 1 capital will be 4.5% and 6%, respectively
 - A new buffer called as Capital conservation buffer with Tier 1 capital needs to maintained at 2.5% of the RWA. banks may be required to maintain 
      a "Counter cyclical buffer" ranging from 0% to 2.5%. Introduced conservation buffer, the requirement of capital increases to 10.5%. 
 - A new measure called leverage ratio is introduced. It measures the proportion of Tier 1 capital to the total exposure of the bank ( Not RWA). 
   A minimum ratio of 3% is to be maintained.
   
- The theoretical reason for holding capital is that it should provide protection against unexpected losses. Note that this is not the same as expected losses. 
  provisions and reserves are for expected losses.
- Tier 1 Capital from a bank perspective includes common stock, retained earnings and also non-redeemable, non-cumulative preferred shares.  
  The regulator would deem the above Tier 1 capital.
- Tier 2 Capital includes supplementary capital such as undisclosed reserves, revaluation reserves, general loan loss reserves, hybrid (debt/equity) capital and 
  subordinated debt.
- Provision: Two Tyep i.e. Generic which is at portfolio level and another individual level (IIP) for impaired account. 
  When CLTV is less than OSTD then it will call as Impaired accounts
- Economics Capital decided by Bank based on capital formula. Regulatory capital decided by regulator for a bank based on risk 
- Loan Loss Provision(LLP): A LLP is currently considered as an adjustment of the book value of a loan which regards future changes in the loan’s value due to default events.
- Expected Loss (EL):  EL denotes the expected amount of a loan that will be lost within one year in the case of a default.
- Provision : The accounting entry for adjusting the balance in the allowance account involves the income statement account uncollectible accounts expense.

- **Loss**: The IRB approach is based on measures of unexpected losses (UL) and expected losses (EL). The risk-weight functions produce capital requirements for the UL portion. 
  In cases where an IRB treatment is not specified, the risk weight for those other exposures is 100% and the resulting risk-weighted assets are assumed to represent UL only.
  Banks must calculate an EL as PD x LGD for corporate, sovereign, bank, and retail exposures not in default. Expected losses are treated separately. 
  While it is never possible to know in advance the losses a bank will suffer in a particular year, a bank can forecast the average level of credit losses it can reasonably
  expect to experience. These losses are referred to as Expected Losses (EL). Financial institutions view Expected Losses as a cost component of doing business, 
  and manage them by a number of means,  including through the pricing of credit exposures and through provisioning. Peak losses do not occur every year, but when they occur,
  they can potentially be very large. Losses above expected levels are usually referred to as Unexpected Losses (UL). Interest rates, including risk premia, charged on credit
  exposures may absorb some components of unexpected losses, but the market will not support prices sufficient to cover all unexpected losses. Capital is needed to cover the
  risks of such peak losses, and therefore it has a loss-absorbing function. The Basel risk weight functions used for the derivation of supervisory capital charges for
  Unexpected Losses (UL).  the sum of UL and EL for an exposure (i.e. its conditional expected loss) is equal to the product of a conditional PD and a “downturn” LGD.
    - Expected loss (EL): The average loss of entity due to counterparties defaults. Covered by margin and provisions. 
      in currency amounts -> PD * EAD * LGD,  in percentage -> EL = PD * LGD
    - Unexpected loss (UL) : The maximum loss exceeding the expected loss with given confidence level. Covered by capital



- **Capital requirement ( K )**: Supervisors will require the bank to calculate its regulatory capital requirement as the sum of expected loss (EL) and unexpected loss (UL).
  The total capital ratio must be no lower than 8%. Tier 2 capital is limited to 100% of Tier 1 capital. Banks have an incentive to minimise the capital they hold, 
  because reducing capital frees up economic resources that can be directed to profitable investments. On the other hand, the less capital a bank holds, 
  the greater is the likelihood that it will not be able to meet its own debt obligations, i.e. that losses in a given year will not be covered by profit plus 
  available capital, and that the bank will become insolvent. Thus, banks and their supervisors must carefully balance the risks and rewards of holding capital.
    - Regulatory Capital = 8%*RWA ,
    - RWA: 12.5%* RC
    - Capital: RWA x 8%

    - Subtracting EL (PD * LGD) from the conditional expected loss for an exposure yields a “UL-only” capital requirement.
    - Banks are required to use estimate of EL, which in many cases will be lower than the downturn LGD.  
    - The difference of the downturn LGD and the best estimate of EL represents the UL capital charge for defaulted assets.

- **Risk-weighted assets**: 
    - Non-Default = K x 12.5 x EAD*1.06       (12.5% is reciprical of 8%, effectively: 8% * 12.5% = 1.0)
    - Default     = K x 12.5 x EAD            (K = Max ((Downturn LGD with floor – BE LGD without floor), 0)

- **Asset Correlation ( R )**:
    - Residential mortgage exposures : 15%
    - Revolving retail exposures : 4%
    - Other retail exposures : 0.12 × (1 - EXP(-50 × PD)) / (1 - EXP(-50)) + 0.24 × [1 - (1 - EXP(-50 × PD))/(1 - EXP(-50))]
    - The asset correlation function is built of two limit correlations of 12% and 24% for very high and very low PDs (100% and 0%, respectively).
      The degree of the obligor’s exposure to the systematic risk factor is expressed by the asset correlation. The asset correlations, in short, 
      show how the asset value of one borrower depends on the asset value of another borrower. Likewise, the correlations could be described as the dependence of the asset
      value of a borrower on the general state of the economy -  all borrowers are linked to each other by this single risk factor. The asset correlations finally determine 
      the shape of the risk weight formulas. They are asset class dependent, because different borrowers and/or asset classes show different degrees of dependency on 
      the overall economy. Portfolio where interactions between borrowers are high, and where borrower defaults are strongly linked to the status of the overall economy. 
      An example for such a portfolio would be the large corporate loan book of a bank, as empirical evidence supports that the financial conditions of larger firms are 
      closer related to the general conditions in the economy.  Asset correlations decrease with increasing PDs. the higher the PD, the higher the idiosyncratic (individual)
      risk components of a borrower. Asset correlations increase with firm size. the larger a firm, the higher its dependency upon the overall state of the economy, 
      and vice versa. The assets correlation express the degree in which the asset value of one obligor depends (correlates) on the asset value of another obligor. 
      In the same manner, assets correlations could also be described as ependencies of the obligor‟s assets on the entire state of the economy all obligors are connected 
      with each other with this single factor. Correlation is a single factor which reflects how the various obligors in the market are related to each other. 
      Basel II accord uses the different correlation for different assets to assess the capital requirement though they are prematurely fixed depending on the kind of assets.

- **PIT PD vs TTC PD**: 
    - Basel II introduced the concept of a long-run PD, which is commonly associated with the expected default rates over a period of time covering at least an economic cycle.
      The introduction of this concept has major modelling implications that have to be addressed while considering each bank environment and constraints. 
    - Best practices: A firm must estimate PDs by grade from long-run averages of 1 year default rates. The long-run average must include default rates from a representative 
      mix of good and bad years for the economy. PDs must be forward-looking – a simple extrapolation from historical data is only a starting point.
    - Constraints: Lack of economic cycle within Australia. Differing downturns not necessarily predictive of future downturns.
    - A point in time (PIT) probability of default (PD) assesses the likelihood of default at that point in time. As it assesses risk at a point in time, 
      the borrower will move up or down rating grades through the economic cycle. A PIT rating system is generally prevalent in day-to-day risk management of retail portfolios.
    - Through the cycle (TTC) PDs, in contrast, predict average default rate performance for a particular customer over an economic cycle and ignore short run changes 
      to a customer’s PD. TTC PDs are determined by utilizing macroeconomic variables and non-cyclical risk drivers to predict default rates over an economic cycle. 
    - Variable scalar approach(TTC): The scalar approach consists of converting the PIT PD to a TTC PD via a scalar that varies throughout the credit cycle. 
      This method has been termed the “variable scalar” approach by the FSA. In a benign period with low credit losses, the scalar will adjust the PIT PD upwards to the TTC PD.
      In a downturn period with high credit losses, the adjustment will be downwards.
    - Structural model (TTC): Utilising non-cyclical risk drivers and macroeconomics variables to predict default rates over a complete economic cycle. 
      Recognises that for retail portfolios, banks do not typically collect customer information other than at origination. Non-cyclical components such as loan to value 
      ratio (LVR) and debt service ratio (DSR) used to measure the “quality” of the loan. Recognises that delinquency is a precursor to default, 
      makes no attempt to model <90dpd delinquency i.e. removes behavioural components. This allows changing portfolio composition over time to be identified and 
      the capital held by banks adjusted accordingly. https://actuaries.asn.au/Library/Events/Insights/2012/Presentation-BaselIIRetailModellingApproaches.pdf
    - Point-in-time (PIT) PDs should be used in RWA formulas, supporting our view that through-the-cycle (TTC) PDs should be used for capital requirement calculations. 
      If the PD used is not TTC, it will vary with the cycle, and the capital requirement will also vary. This is the background to the discussion on procyclicality: 
      In adverse times, capital requirements for banks may increase, forcing them to cut lending. Hence the cycle will be strengthened, which is clearly an undesired effect.
      
      
      
- **Stress RWA**:       
   -  The Vasicek formula is used to convert the Base PDs (or ODRs in the case of standardized portfolios) into a stressed value that can be expected under 
      the assumed severity of the scenario. Its part of pillar 1 stress testing 
   -  Stress RWA calculation:
         -  Target ODR: Average IFRS 9 PD 
         -  Apply target ODR in Pillar-1 model (not for base year) to get the % a/c across delinquency bucket. Current bucket should be adjusted in the last (to get 100%)
         -  Distribute base year delinquency wise accounts according to Pillar-1 adjusted accounts (#2). Apply same method for year 2 to 5. 
         -  Post account movement adjust below
               -  Score (A & B) : Difference of average score from one bucket to another. Convert score into TTC PD.
               -  Calculate PMA (IRB PD by Target ODR) and apply on converted PD. Adjust PMA to get close to target ODR. PMA required for all years except base year
               -  Recalculated LTV to adjust account movement
               -  Calculate Capital requirement, RWA and Capital

-  Long Run Probability of Default (LRPD) model covers three key categories:
   -  PD Model Development: Model uses months on book, product, delinquency status, and scorecards as segment. Next, the initial PD is estimated using credit 
      scores based on period of at least five years of data. The model is calibrated by mapping the available credit scores to estimates of the probability of 
      default using logistic regression. An additional risk driver maybe included to capture additional risk perspective, if required.
   -  Identify Deficiencies and Apply Adjustment: Assessment is made to identify deficiencies category A and B; 
      and apply the appropriate adjustments to correct the deficiencies during modelling.
   -  LRPD Calibration & Cyclicality Assessment: Once the initial PD model is built, a long-run adjustment factor is applied to calibrate the initial PD estimates 
      to long-run average ODR that covers a full economic cycle.

-  Afterwards, an assessment is performed to understand the cyclicality of PD model rating system between the Through-the-Cycle (TTC) and Point-in-Time (PiT) spectrum. 
   If the historical data does not sufficiently cover the long-run period, and adjustment might be required, including imputing PRA’s 30% cyclicality cap for 
   the long-run average default rate period that includes period of missing ODR

-  Margin of Conservatism (MoC): Finally, MoC is added to the final model estimates to account for i) the uncertainties arising from adjustments made to correct 
   the deficiencies, or ii) general estimation error (category C).

-  LRPD model is considered following hybrid rating philosophy given that the LRPD estimates are derived based on i) credit scorecards which may include 
   Point-in-Time (PIT) elements i.e. recent delinquency, current LTV; and ii) calibrated to long-run average default rate over the cycle (TTC) in nature. 
   The resulting PD model is assessed against cyclicality requirements and incorporate further adjustments if required. The LRPD model aims to provide a 
   relatively stable PD estimate over the cycle when compared to the observed default rates that are cyclical by nature. This means that the RWA and 
   Expected Loss (EL) are expected to be relatively stable over the course of the business cycle. The consequence of this approach is that, 
   we can expect the PD estimates to under or overpredict the observed default rates, depending on whether the economic is under recessionary or benign condition. 

-  Fixed PD: a constant value of PD is assigned to each obligor. The PD is often based directly on the observed default rate (ODR) in that segment. 
   This constant PD could be equal to:
      -  The development sample ODR: i.e. (number of default)/ (sample size).
      -  Simple average of yearly ODRs: This definition is akin to PRAs definition of long run average default which it stipulates to be the simple arithmetic 
         average of yearly ODRs. Two snapshots with different sample sizes will get the same weight (unlike in method (a) which is equivalent to taking weighted 
         average of yearly ODRS with weight equal to sample size). Each year getting an equal weight results in each economic scenario getting weighted 
         proportional to its frequency of occurrence. Completely disregarding the sample size however might result in higher than optimal standard errors 
         on the PD estimates.
     -   Maximum observed ODR: This is a conservative approach where the ODR from the snapshot with worst performance is attached as PD. 
     -   A PD value derived from another similar segment. For e.g. for an unscored segment, the PD could be taken from the corresponding scored segment 
         with appropriate conservatisms applied.

      -  PD(t) is long-run average PD at time t, 
      -  DR(t) is observed default rate at time t 
   
-  PD Adjustment factor computation:

      -  Q2 -> ODR=0.062%, adjustment L2= LOG(odr)-LOG(1-odr) = -7.38
      -  Adjustment Factor (c) = L(2)-L(1) = 0.994
