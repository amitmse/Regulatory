**International Financial Reporting Standards 9(IFRS 9)**

ECLs reflect management’s expectations of shortfalls in the collection of contractual cash flows.

IFRS 9 is a financial reporting standard developed and approved by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), an independent, private-sector body that develops and approves International Financial Reporting Standards. IFRS 9 concerns the accounting and reporting specifically of financial instruments. The standard is applicable for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 while earlier application is permitted. The objective of IFRS 9 is to establish principles for the financial reporting of financial assets and liabilities that will present relevant and useful information to users of financial statements for their assessment of the amounts, timing and uncertainty of an entity’s future cash flows. Alongside disclosures mandated by regulators (e.g. Basel Pillar III reporting requires for regulated banks) these financial statements are the main source of information about the Balance Sheet of a financial institution.

IFRS 9 was issued in response to the mandate received from the G20 in the light of the performance of accounting standards during the global financial crisis. The new standard specifies a fuller and more timely recognition of credit losses, thus enhancing both the size of loss-absorbing allowances and their responsiveness to information pointing to a deterioration or improvement in credit risk.

The introduction of the IFRS 9 standard has significant repercussions for bank Risk Management as it requires:

·        Embedding forward looking risk assessments in the measurement (assessment) of the firm's financial condition

·        Disclosing such assessments to external stakeholders

While the transition to the ECL approach requires a significant investment in new models, the adoption of IFRS 9 could benefit banks by improving their internal credit risk monitoring systems. While banks currently using the advanced internal ratings-based approach (IRB) to establish their capital requirements can adjust their models, banks solely using the standardised approach (SA) to determining their capital requirements may need to develop models from scratch

The standard contains four main sections:

Recognition and Derecognition: (Initial) recognition denotes the first inclusion of an asset or liability in financial reporting. Reporting entities must recognise a financial asset or a financial liability in its statement of financial position when, and only when, the entity becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument (e.g. when originating or purchasing an asset). Derecognition denotes the exclusion of an asset or liability from reporting when when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire, or the reporting entity transfers the financial asset
Classification: Recognition of financial assets and liabilities requires their classification into one of the three available categories (Amortized Cost, FVOCI, FVPL) which subsequently determines how the financial asset or liability is measured and reported in financial statements.
Measurement: IFRS 9 retained the concept of fair value option from IAS 39, but revised the criteria for financial assets. Under a fair value option, an asset or liability that would otherwise be reported at amortized cost or FVOCI can use FVPL instead. IFRS 9 retained most of the measurement guidance for liabilities from IAS 39, meaning most financial liabilities are held at amortized cost. Under IFRS 9 measurement involves assigning each asset to one of three stages, depending on the relative change in its credit risk. The stage determines principally: 1. the way in which the impairment loss is calculated, 2. whether the accrual of interest income is made on the basis of the gross or net carrying amount of the financial asset.
Impairment Loss: One of the most important changes brought by the IFRS 9 standard is the requirement for an Impairment Allowance held against the amortized cost of financial assets. The change in this allowance is to be reported in profit and loss. This new impairment model is intended to address a criticism of the existing impairment model which allows companies to delay recognition of asset impairments. For most amortized cost assets, when the asset is acquired the impairment allowance is to be measured as the present value of credit losses from default events projected over the next 12 months. The allowance remains based on the Expected Credit Loss from defaults over the next 12 months unless there is a Significant Increase in Credit Risk. If there is a significant increase in credit risk, the allowance is measured as the present value of all credit losses projected for the instrument over its full lifetime. If the credit risk of the asset improves, the allowance can once again be revert to the projected credit losses over the next 12 months.
Expected Credit Loss (ECL) is the probability-weighted estimate of credit losses (i.e., the present value of all cash shortfalls) over the expected life of a Financial Instrument. A cash shortfall is the difference between the cash flows that are due to an entity in accordance with the contract (scheduled or contractual cashflows) and the cash flows that the entity expects to receive (actual expected cashflows). Because expected credit losses consider the amount and timing of payments, a credit loss arises even if the entity expects to be paid in full but later than when contractually due. ECL can be measured either at an individual exposure level or a collective portfolio level (grouped exposures based on shared credit risk characteristics)

The expected credit loss is to be covered by provisions, and unexpected loss is to be covered by capital. As a consequence, loss provisions will significantly increase under IFRS 9, thus reducing the equity and retained earnings available for Tier 1 capital, which in turn may reduce the Tier 1 capital ratio.

In general A‐IRB loss estimation is an “economic loss”, whereas IFRS 9 loss estimation is an “accounting loss”. Indirect recovery expenses (e.g. overhead, etc.), which are included in A‐IRB’s economic loss by being incorporated in LGD estimations, are supposed to be excluded from the IFRS 9 calculation as they cannot be directly allocated to individual loans from an accounting standpoint.

https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d385.pdf International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the US Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) have adopted provisioning standards that require the use of expected credit loss (ECL) models rather than incurred loss models. The IASB published International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) 9 in July 2014, which will take effect on 1 January 2018 (earlier application is permitted). The FASB published its final standard on current expected credit losses (CECL) in June 2016. The FASB’s new standard will take effect on 1 January 2020 for certain banks that are public companies and in 2021 for all other banks, with early application permitted for all banks in 2019. The new IFRS 9 and CECL provisioning standards share similar objectives for the earlier recognition of credit losses than under incurred loss models. Likewise, both the IASB’s and the FASB’s models require expected credit losses to be estimated not only on the basis of past events and current conditions, but also reasonable and supportable forecasts about the future, including future economic conditions. There are, however, differences between the IFRS 9 and CECL ECL models, and regulatory expected loss (EL) calculated under the internal ratings-based (IRB) approach in Basel III (regulatory EL). The high-level differences between IFRS 9, CECL and regulatory EL are described in Annex 1. The IRB regulatory EL estimates use a 12-month PD. IFRS 9 uses a 12-month PD in Stage 1 and a lifetime PD in Stages 2 and 3. The CECL model uses a lifetime PD for all assets without regard to stages.

Adapting the Basel II advanced internalratings-based models for International Financial Reporting Standard 9. -> In general, A-IRB loss estimation is an “economic loss”, whereas IFRS 9 loss estimation is an “accounting loss”. The downturn LGD adjustment used in A-IRB is not appropriate for IFRS 9, as it is an adjustment for the tail of the loss distribution to compensate for the fact that the Basel II formula ignores the correlations between the PD and LGD.

SICR:

MG: The analysis is based on simulating the portfolio for a range of triggers: absolute triggers from 0-15% and relative triggers from 0-500%.
For non-mortgage portfolios:
(i) A minimum flow from Stage 2 to Stage 3 over the next 12 months of 25%

(ii) At least 30% of accounts enter Stage 2 before missing a payment; and

(iii)The account weighted Stage 2 population as a proportion of the Stage 1 and 2 population is higher than the portfolio’s Observed Default Rate (ODR).

•A single threshold of 3.5% absolute and 100% relative difference broadly satisfies the criteria for all portfolios except low default portfolio. For low risk unsecured portfolio: a higher threshold is needed to ensure high flow rate of accounts from Stage 2 to Stage 3 

Stress testing: https://www.bis.org/publ/bcbs147.pdf

Its part of Second Pillar - Supervisory Review Process. Stress testing is an important risk management tool that is used by banks as part of their internal risk management and, through the Basel II capital adequacy framework, is promoted by supervisors. Providing forward-looking assessments of risk; • overcoming limitations of models and historical data; • supporting internal and external communication; • feeding into capital and liquidity planning procedures; • informing the setting of a banks’ risk tolerance; and • facilitating the development of risk mitigation or contingency plans across a range of stressed conditions. For a given economic scenario the approach uses

The IFRS 9 models that have been built to estimate each portfolio’s IFRS 9 ECL under multiple economic scenarios; and
The Pillar 1 stress testing frameworks that have been built to estimate the regulatory RWA and EL under different economic scenarios for the IRB portfolios. 
These models are combined in the portal with the Business Volumes and Margins (estimates each portfolio’s balance sheet growth over the scenario) to calculate the portfolio’s loan impairments, IFRS 9 ECL, regulatory RWA and EL over the scenario(s).

Retail Pillar 1 stress test framework: For IRB portfolios the framework is designed to estimate the RWA and EL for a given scenario. This is done by simulating how the key components of the rating system (that have a material impact on RWA) would react to a stress scenario. The Pillar 1 frameworks were built to estimate the EAD in each month on book (MOB) and delinquency cohort (rather than estimating the number of accounts). This removes the need for an EAD per account adjustment to be made in the portal. The Pillar 1 framework contains a set of equations that give the relationship between the portfolio’s observed default rates (ODR) and the percentage of the portfolio EAD in each of these cohorts. For example, for a balance weighted ODR of 5% the equations would tell us what percentage of the < 6 MOB EAD would be current, X DPD (1-29 DPD), 30 DPD, 60 DPD or in default.

Stage 2 EAD should peak on day 1 and then start to recover and largely mean revert by Y5. Stage 3 EAD is not expected to peak until Y2, given that arrears may take time to manifest themselves. Post Y2 stage 3 EAD should recover as there will be flows to write-off (the example assumed a 12 months write-off policy). The PRA expects firms to hold the maximum expected credit loss (ECL) in Y1, however, the peak stage 2 ECL should be held on day 1. As disclosed in the stress testing publication the PRA expects firm to recognise ~80% of the cumulative impairment charge by Y2. The lifetime PD for all exposures will be calculated as the average of the 12-month IFRS 9 PDs over the remaining life of the exposure in any given stress year.

Ideally below should be used:

A more appropriate lifetime definition would be the sum of marginal 12-months PDs as marginal PD considers the probability of survival of exposures up to that point. However, an average of 12-month PDs was selected as the lifetime PD to be reported for stress testing based on R&C’s recommendation. This is to ensure alignment with the PD used in the SICR calculation for staging during the BAU ECL reporting. 
Under a constant term structure, the remaining life of exposures would reduce every year. However, a moving average was consciously chosen as lifetime PD instead of a reducing term structure. Ideally, exposures in the next year would age by 12-months and some would attrite, and new originations would replace the attrition. However, as account level calculations are done in system with a fixed balance sheet, a reducing term structure would mean that after year 2-3 years, the number of exposures in the portfolio would reduce considerably (attrite) and hence the averages based on the remaining exposures could be skewed. Hence, by using a moving average 12-month PD definition as lifetime we assume that exposures that attrite are replaced by other exposures of similar credit quality, and hence the distribution across the cohorts remain similar throughout the stress horizon. As 12-month PDs keep decreasing over the later years of a term structure, the moving average assumption does not contribute to a significant difference in the exposure level Lifetime PD – i.e. lifetime PD based on Y1-Y3 would not be significantly different than a lifetime PD based on Y1-Y2 alone.
Portal:

Step 1: A combination of the portfolio EAD distribution across the non-default cohorts in Year 0 and the Year 0 FL PDs (which are estimated using the Year 0 stress scenario) are used to estimate the portfolio ODR over Year 0.

Step 2: The ODR estimated in step 1 is input into the Pillar 1 equations that give the relationship between the portfolio’s ODR and the percentage of the portfolio EAD in each of the cohorts for Year 1. The portfolio’s exposure is then redistributed across the cohorts to match the percentages from these equations. The distribution is also adjusted to take the account of the balance sheet growth assumptions from the BVM.

Step 3: Using the new EAD distribution, the portfolio RWA, regulatory EL and IFRS 9 ECL are then recalculated (i.e. giving the stressed Year 1 values for these metrics).

Steps 1- 3 are then repeated for each year of the scenario. i.e. the portfolio EAD distribution across the cohorts in Year 1 (from Step 3 above) and the Year 1 FL PDs are used to estimate the portfolio ODR over Year 1.

Loan Impairment (LI) is calculated as a sum of: ECL charge; Loss at Write-off . ECL Charge: The ECL charge (which can often be referred to as the LI) is the difference between the ECL in the current and the previous year. For both the mortgages and unsecured portfolios the ECL Charge is calculated as: ECL Charge Yi = ECL Yi - ECL Yi-1 Loss at Write-off: After an exposure has defaulted, the loss (calculated using the default LGD model) is recognised in the next year (this recognition of the loss is referred to as the loss at write-off). With perfect foresight, the Stage 3 ECL from one year is taken as the loss at write-off in the next year. For all portfolios (secured and unsecured), the loss at write-off is calculated as: Loss at Write-off Yi = Stage 3 ECL Yi-1 = Stage 3 EAD Yi-1 * default LGD Yi-1.

Vasicek model has been leveraged to estimate the conditional PDs in each scenario year. where p(z) is conditional probability of default for a given systematic factor z & thita is standard normal distribution, thita inverse is inverse of standard normal distribution, P is TTC PD and p is asset correlation. According to Vasicek model assumption, z should follow normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 1. The equation requires three inputs: TTC PD, asset correlation, and systematic factor. TTC PD: This input takes the value of long run average of count weighted observed default rate of the portfolio / segment. Asset correlation p : Under this approach, asset correlation is taken for different products as recommended by Basel. Systematic factor, z: This input to Vasicek formula represents the systematic risk that a portfolio may be subjected to. PD = Thita [ thita inverse p - z * sqrt of p / sqrt of 1 -p]
